To Do:

+ Replicate universal key mapping from Karabiner in Karabiner-Elements
  - Finish NumPad mappings (Remote Buddy)
- Replicate Microsoft Sculpt device-specific mappings
- Replicate Steam Controller device-specific mappings

Ideas for key mapping using Karabiner (now Karabiner-Elements):

* Prevent unintended Cmd-Q
  - I used a mapping to require a long-press to activate command-Q, but the extra inconvenience seems to outweigh the benefits. Maybe a shorter delay would help?  A double-press also feels like too much extra effort.
  - https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/#command_q

* Sticky Fn (as opposed to Fn-lock): double-tap Fn to apply fn to the next key pressed.
  - This may need an extra variable to track the double-press.
  - or it toggles the sticky_fn variable if pressed alone; fn modifier if pressed alone?
    - this is simpler in terms of code, but may not be convenient to use.
