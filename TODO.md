+ add dotsync submodule to repo.
    - edit install.sh script to automatically run dotsync commands
    - modify dotsync to accept any host as valid, if default listed in dotsyncrc (host "[DEFAULT]") - and use those settings for any other host not listed.

* add system setup / bootstrap / config scripts (brew, osx.sh)

* R script to install .Renviron and .Rprofile to HOME (platform-independent, get R running faster).
