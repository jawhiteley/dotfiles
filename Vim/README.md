Common configuration files for Vim >7.4
(The Vim-R-plugin now requires Vim 7.4).

Sub-folders in this folder can be *copied* directly to the `.vim` (or `vimfiles` on Windows) directory.
Copy the vimrc file to the appropriate location on your system (and rename to `.vimrc`, as appropriate). Edit it to point to this folder and it will source the rest from common files here.
