This is a copy of the .vim directory on my Mac, which works with McVim 7.3.
MacVim 7.4 does something strange with installing plugins using vim-plug: it claims to install everything, but hangs before finishing.
Vim 7.4 is required for current plugins (notably vim-r). I'm going back to my old setup using Vim 7.3, which worked. I will "upgrade" to 7.4 and this system once I have more time for all this.
